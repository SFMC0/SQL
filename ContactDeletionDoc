### Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) Contact Deletion Process Documentation

This document outlines the process of implementing and automating contact deletion in Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC). The workflow ensures a systematic and efficient way to identify, stage, and delete contacts from the system while monitoring progress and logging all operations.

---

#### **1. Overview of the Process**
The contact deletion process involves:
1. **Identifying contacts**: Contacts present in "All Contacts" but not in "All Subscribers."
2. **Staging the contacts**: Staging identified contacts in a dedicated data extension for further processing.
3. **Automating the deletion**: A multi-step automation ensures proper deletion, error handling, and status updates.
4. **Monitoring and logging**: Logging all operations, including errors, and using monitoring automations for process continuity.

#### **2. Primary Automation Workflow**

**Step 1: Initial Contact Filtering**
- Contacts from the staging data extension are picked up for deletion.
- An exclusion process removes any contacts that may still exist in the "All Subscribers" list.
- The filtered list of contacts is stored in a "Current Deletion" data extension for further processing.

**Step 2: Contact Deletion Submission (SSJS)**
- An SSJS script takes the contacts in the "Current Deletion" data extension and submits them for deletion using the Contact Deletion API.
- The submission generates a unique `Operation ID` for the deletion request.
- This step logs:
  - Submission details
  - `Operation ID`
  - Any errors encountered during submission.

**Step 3: Wait Step**
- A wait step of 20 minutes ensures the deletion process initiated in Step 2 progresses before proceeding.

**Step 4: Status Check and Update (SSJS)**
- An SSJS script retrieves the `Operation ID` for the previous submission from the log data extension.
- It checks the deletion status via the Contact Deletion API.
- The current status of the deletion process is updated in the log data extension.
- Logged details include:
  - Current status of the deletion (e.g., completed, pending, failed).
  - Any errors encountered during status checking.

#### **3. Monitoring Automations**

Two separate monitoring automations ensure smooth operation and handle retries or process continuation:

**Monitoring Automation 1**
- Retrieves the `Operation ID` for the latest deletion process from the log data extension.
- Checks the status of the process using the Contact Deletion API.
- If the status is **Pending**, it pauses and waits for a retry.
- If the status is **Completed**, it triggers the main automation to process the next batch of contacts.

**Monitoring Automation 2**
- Functions as a backup to monitor and ensure no operations are left incomplete.
- Similar to Step 4 of the primary automation, it periodically checks the deletion status and logs any errors or inconsistencies.

---

#### **4. Data Extensions**
The following data extensions support the process:

1. **Staging Data Extension**:
   - Stores contacts identified for deletion.
   - Initial source for the deletion automation.

2. **Current Deletion Data Extension**:
   - Stores contacts filtered for deletion in the current batch.
   - Tracks the contacts actively submitted for deletion.

3. **Log Data Extension**:
   - Maintains records of:
     - Contact deletion submissions.
     - Operation IDs.
     - Status updates.
     - Errors (if any).

---

#### **5. Logging and Error Handling**
- All operations and their outcomes are logged into a dedicated log data extension.
- Any errors encountered during submission or status checks are logged for troubleshooting and resolution.
- Detailed error messages enable the identification of root causes.

---

#### **6. API Integration**
The process uses Salesforce Marketing Cloudâ€™s Contact Deletion API to:
- Submit contacts for deletion.
- Retrieve and monitor deletion statuses using unique `Operation IDs`.

---

#### **7. Process Flow Summary**
1. Identify and stage contacts.
2. Process contacts in batches:
   - Exclude from "All Subscribers."
   - Submit for deletion (Step 2).
   - Monitor status (Step 4).
3. Log all operations and errors.
4. Monitor and continue the process using automation loops.
